02 Homework to create Portfolio

## Description
This project is to work on our Portfolio.  This will help us store and showcase the work we will be doing in class with UCF Coding Bootcamp, as well as our personal work.  This will be an ever-changing document as I learn, create, add and grow with the tech community.  

## Table of Contents of Portfolio
1. Heading
2. Navigation bar
3. About me
4. Projects
5. Contact Me
6. Credits

## How to Navigate the Portfolio Project
In the header, I have created a Navigation bar.  You can hover and select the different text to move to an area on the screen.  The images below the Work heading will showcase the projects I have completed.  
Note:  I have only created on project, titled "Learning".  Click on the picture to view the project.  The other four are stand alone images with no link.  In the Navigation bar in the Header, you can click on Contact Me or Resume that will take you to the bottom of the page for my contact info, GitHub page and a link to the resume.
